🌲 **The Creators Behind Poppy Stays** 🌲  

Every great story has its heroes—and at Poppy Stays, 
we are lucky to have two exceptional individuals who helped us bring our vision to life: Maya De Leat and Rado Ross.  

*****************************************
* Maya De Leat – The Visionary Designer *
*****************************************

Maya is the creative genius who helped shape the visual identity of Poppy Stays. 
With a passion for design and a keen eye for detail, she brought our brand’s essence to life through our logo. 
Inspired by the natural beauty of the outdoors and the warmth of community, 
Maya’s work captures the spirit of adventure and relaxation we aim to offer our guests.  

From the first draft to the final design, Maya worked hard to ensure that every detail of the Poppy Stays logo embodies the core of our mission. 
Her artistic touch extends across all of our branding, from our website to our promotional materials, 
creating a cohesive and welcoming atmosphere for everyone who engages with our platform. 
Thanks to Maya, we are able to visually communicate the excitement and peace that comes with every adventure with Poppy Stays.  

**********************************************
* Rado Ross – The Mastermind Behind Our Name *  
**********************************************

Rado Ross played a crucial role in crafting the name “Poppy Stays” itself. 
As a storyteller, Rado’s input was instrumental in shaping a name that not only sounds inviting but also encapsulates everything we stand for. 
Through his deep understanding of branding and narrative, Rado helped define our mission to offer exceptional stays in the heart of nature.  

Rado’s influence on Poppy Stays goes beyond just naming. 
His ability to see the bigger picture, understanding what we wanted our community to feel, is reflected in every aspect of the brand. 
The name "Poppy Stays" evokes warmth, comfort, and a promise of wonderful and unforgettable memories. 
qualities that Rado helped bring to life with his creativity and insight.  

Both Maya and Rado’s contributions have shaped the Poppy Stays you know and love today, and for that, we are eternally grateful.
