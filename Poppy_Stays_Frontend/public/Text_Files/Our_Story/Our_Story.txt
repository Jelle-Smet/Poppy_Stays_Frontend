🌲 **How It All Started** 🌲  

Poppy Stays was born from a simple but powerful idea:  
**What if finding the perfect camping spot or BnB was as effortless as enjoying the trip itself?**  

With a love for the great outdoors and a knack for curating memorable getaways, our founder, 
an avid explorer and dreamer, set out to create something special.  
What began as a small project quickly blossomed into a vibrant platform that connects travelers with **unique, handpicked spaces**
each one chosen for its charm, beauty, and comfort.  

From serene lakeside escapes to warm, cozy BnBs with all the amenities you love, we’ve got something for every travel style.

- Everyone deserves a space to recharge and reconnect with nature.  
- Travel should be easy, enjoyable, and tailored to YOU.

From comfy camping spots to welcoming BnBs, every listing on our site is chosen with care.
